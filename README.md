# Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning  | Flask | FastAPI

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges faced by subscription-based businesses such as telecom, banking, and SaaS companies. This project focuses on predicting whether a customer is likely to leave a service using machine learning techniques.

The goal of this project is to analyze customer behavior, identify churn patterns, and build predictive models that help businesses improve customer retention strategies.

## Objectives

- **Analyze customer demographic and service usage data**

- **Identify key factors contributing to customer churn**

- **Build machine learning models to predict churn probability**

- **Evaluate model performance using classification metrics**

- **Provide business insights for customer retention strategies**

## Dataset

**The dataset used in this project contains customer information including:**

Customer demographics

Account details

Services subscribed

Billing and payment information

Churn status

## Dataset Source:
(Telco Customer Churn Dataset – [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn])
